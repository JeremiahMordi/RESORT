# RESORT PROJECT.
**GOAL**: The goal for this project is to show a simple resort website sample by displaying and offering details on what it looks like when it 
is rendered in a browser.

**What is The Emblem Resorts Project?** 
The Emblem Resorts Project is a site built to showcase The Emblem Resorts to a wider audience range thereby bringing in more customers for the 
business and building its online presence.

The project is also a web version of The Emblem Resorts. Obtaining information on location, various accomodation styles, amenities, activites and so on  
are just a few things we can do with the project. 

**How To Run The Site**
1. The very first thing necessary for the running of this project is a stable internet connection.
2. A computer with internet access features and a high processing speed. [The first two things are merely peripheral needs.]
3. The main thing needd to run the project is the code which structures the project.

*BUGS:* 
1. There are no bugs in this project.
